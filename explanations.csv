Service Iteam,What & Why (Short Explanation),Northern Montana Conditions
120K Service,"The 120K Service is a comprehensive, high-mileage maintenance package designed to restore peak performance, prevent costly failures, and extend the life of your vehicle by addressing every major system — all backed by our Best Price Promise.","In severe climates, systems wear faster. These scheduled intervals are designed to catch problems before they become failures — they’re not just mileage-based, but condition-based."
15K Service,"First major interval: air filters, oil system clean, brake flush, and fluid replacements.","In severe climates, systems wear faster. These scheduled intervals are designed to catch problems before they become failures — they’re not just mileage-based, but condition-based."
30K Service,"Mid-life service: includes transmission, coolant, spark plugs, and driveline fluids.","In severe climates, systems wear faster. These scheduled intervals are designed to catch problems before they become failures — they’re not just mileage-based, but condition-based."
60K Service,Pre-high mileage check: repeat of key services to extend reliability and performance.,"In severe climates, systems wear faster. These scheduled intervals are designed to catch problems before they become failures — they’re not just mileage-based, but condition-based."
90K Service,High-mileage care: all major systems serviced to protect long-term performance and value.,"In severe climates, systems wear faster. These scheduled intervals are designed to catch problems before they become failures — they’re not just mileage-based, but condition-based."
Air Filter,Improves engine airflow and fuel efficiency by filtering debris.,Cold air + dusty roads = more contaminants. Clogged filters reduce performance and fuel economy — needs more frequent replacement.
Automatic Transmission Fluid Service,Prevents shifting issues by replacing worn fluid.,Cold temps thicken fluid and increase pressure on seals. Dirty fluid = hard shifting or slipping. Fresh fluid ensures smooth operation in freezing weather.
Brake Fluid Flush,Restores brake responsiveness by removing moisture from the system.,Moisture in brake lines can freeze or corrode internal parts. Essential in cold/wet conditions.
Cabin Filter,Cleans interior air and helps HVAC system work efficiently.,"More dust, road grime, and heater use = faster clogging. A dirty filter reduces airflow, fogs up windows, and strains your HVAC."
Cooling system Flush,Prevents overheating by removing old coolant and buildup.,Freezing temps test your coolant’s protection. Old fluid can freeze or corrode the system — coolant needs strong freeze protection.
Engine Oil Supplement,Enhances lubrication and reduces engine wear.,"In cold starts, oil takes longer to circulate. This supplement improves cold-start lubrication and engine protection."
Engine Oil supplement and cleaning system,Cleans internal engine deposits for smoother performance.,Sludge builds up faster with short trips and cold starts. This cleaning system removes harmful deposits.
Ethanol Defender fuel system additive,Cleans fuel system and protects against ethanol damage.,"Ethanol attracts moisture, and in winter that can freeze. This additive helps protect against fuel line freezing and corrosion."
GDI Injection clean and throttle body clean,Removes carbon buildup for better performance and MPG.,"In colder weather, carbon builds up faster. This service improves idle, fuel economy, and cold-weather drivability."
Oil Change,Replaces dirty oil with clean oil to protect engine life.,Severe weather = severe oil breakdown. Cold starts and stop-and-go winter driving demand shorter oil intervals and full synthetic.
Power Steering Flush,Ensures smooth steering by renewing steering fluid.,Cold fluid thickens and can damage seals or cause stiff steering. Flushing keeps steering smooth in the cold.
Rear Differential Service,Protects rear axle gears in AWD/4WD by replacing gear oil.,Cold oil becomes thicker; dirt roads + AWD use accelerate gear wear. Clean fluid = smoother power delivery.
Spark Plug Replacement,Improves ignition for better MPG and engine performance.,"Cold starts demand more spark energy. Worn plugs cause hard starts, poor fuel economy, and misfires."
Tire Rotation,Promotes even tire wear and extends tire life.,"Uneven wear is accelerated by potholes, snow buildup, and gravel roads. Regular rotations maximize tire life and winter grip."
Transfer Case Service,Protects AWD/4WD system by replacing transfer case fluid.,AWD systems work harder in snow/ice. Old fluid breaks down under stress. Clean fluid protects 4WD engagement and internal gears.
